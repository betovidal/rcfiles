# My very own rcfiles
Yup, that's it, nothing relevant to say.

## Where do each file belongs:

* ~/.vimrc
* ~/.profile (paste its contents at the end of the file)
* ~/.xinitrc
* ~/.config/ranger/rifle.conf (manual edit, just in case)
* ~/.config/ranger/rc.conf
* ~/.config/mpv/mpv.conf
* ~/.mednafen/mednafen.cfg
* /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf # To avoid screen tearing, laptop

* All the suckless configurations belong to their respective conf.def.h file.

## TODOS

* Installer script would be nice.
* Clean notes
