tty1 sends output to integrated video card by default. You can override it in two ways.

1. Boot, press 'e' for grub commands. Add "nomodeset" in front of "quiet splash", start with Ctrl+x. It should now send output to the GPU.
2. To make these changes permanent, modify the file /etc/default/grub and add "nomodeset" in front of "quiet splash". Then $sudo update-grub2 (update-grub is the same).

Change "quiet splash" to "text" for more details.
