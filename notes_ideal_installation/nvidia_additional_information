On laptops?, there's an error saying "Deleting Screen 0... etc", when trying to run startx.

https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-928250-start-0.html

solution is to edit/create a file:

/etc/X11/xorg.conf

with the contents:

Section "Device"
    Identifier "Device0"
    Driver "nvidia"
EndSection
